  - [x] EditVideoModal save functionality (already implemented)
  - [x] EditFolderModal save functionality (already implemented)
  - [x] Updated UnifiedEditor page with DirectoryTree
  - [x] Added Live Preview panel to editor with context-aware preview
  - [x] Wired up all API calls for folder/video editing
  
- [x] **Frontend Structure Complete** (P1)
  - [x] UnifiedEditor Folders & Content tab redesigned
  - [x] DirectoryTree integrated (shows empty state when no content)
  - [x] Live Preview shows folder/video details dynamically
  - [x] Form fields with proper enable/disable logic
  - [x] Device preview toggle working

## 🟡 TESTING STATUS
- [x] **Backend Testing** - 100% Complete ✅

## 📝 NOTES

### Recent Changes
- Moved Sliding Window QR watermarking to Phase 3 (per user request)
- Completed comprehensive hashing integration
- Added C2PA manifest creation to upload flow
- Fixed backend syntax error that was blocking startup

### User Preferences
- Focus on core verification system first
- Testing required before finishing tasks
- C2PA is important for future 3rd party integration
- Compression resistance is critical for verification

### Technical Decisions
- Using c2pa-python library for standard compliance
- Perceptual hashing with 16x16 DCT for compression resistance
- Dual SHA-256 approach (original + watermarked)
- C2PA manifests stored as sidecar files (.c2pa)

**Priority Legend:**
- P0 = Blocker (must fix immediately)
- P1 = High (complete this sprint)
- P2 = Medium (next sprint)
- P3 = Low (backlog)
