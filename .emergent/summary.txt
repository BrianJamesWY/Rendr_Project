<analysis>
The user, a founder with a grand vision for a video verification platform called Rendr, initially sought high-level strategic advice. The trajectory began with extensive brainstorming and requirement clarification, moving from a vague idea of a blockchain bodycam to a well-defined three-part product suite:  (mobile app),  (web uploader), and  (verification portal).

The AI engineer's role evolved from a strategic advisor to a technical architect and finally to a hands-on setup guide. Key architectural decisions were made, including a multi-layer verification system (perceptual hashing, sensor data, blockchain timestamps) and a cost-effective storage model (no video storage on project servers for the free tier). A critical technical hurdle was identified: the user's Windows PC and iPhone setup. The AI engineer correctly diagnosed this as a blocker for standard React Native development and successfully proposed using the Expo framework as the solution.

The conversation pivoted from abstract planning to concrete action with the creation of a 13-week roadmap, starting with a Week 1 Proof-of-Concept (POC). The most recent interactions have been focused on executing Day 1 of this POC: setting up the user's development environment. The user has successfully installed Python and Node.js under the AI's guidance. The immediate next step is to install Git. The user's primary language is English. The next agent must respond in English.

<product_requirements>
The product, named Rendr, is a truth verification platform designed to prove the authenticity of video content in an age of AI-generated fakes. It comprises three main components:

1.  **Rendr Bodycam (Mobile App)**: The core product. A mobile app that captures video along with a rich set of metadata (GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope patterns, timestamps). This provides a high-confidence, hardware-level verification with an unbroken chain of custody from capture to signature.

2.  **Rendr Studio (Web Platform)**: A tool for content creators to upload pre-edited videos. It applies a verification watermark and generates a signature. This provides a lower, reputation-based level of verification. It also includes a public-facing Showcase page for each creator to display their portfolio of verified work.

3.  **Rendr Verify (Verification Portal)**: A public web portal where anyone can verify a video. Users can enter a unique code associated with a video to see its original metadata or perform a deep verification by uploading the video file to compare its perceptual hash against the original, blockchain-stored signature.

The MVP will focus on building the mobile app, the verification portal, and the simple desktop upload tool. A premium court-admissible tier, which includes storing the full video on AWS, and a creator analytics dashboard are planned for post-MVP phases.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Multi-Layer Verification**: The core security model, combining several techniques:
  - **Perceptual Hashing**: To create a video fingerprint that survives social media re-encoding.
  - **Sensor Data Fusion**: Using GPS, accelerometer, etc., for a hard-to-fake environmental signature (mobile only).
  - **Blockchain Timestamping**: Using the Polygon network for an immutable, public record of when a video was signed.
- **Cost-Optimized Storage**: Videos are not stored by the service (except for a premium tier). Instead, only the small signature (hashes + metadata) is stored on project servers (MongoDB), and a hash of that signature is stored on the blockchain.
- **React Native with Expo**: The chosen framework for mobile development to overcome the user's Windows + iPhone environment constraint. Expo Go will be used for testing.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project is a full-stack application with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database. No production code has been written yet, but the architecture and key planning documents have been established.

**High-Level Directory Structure (Current & Planned):**


**Key Files Created/Discussed:**

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This is the immediate action plan. It's a comprehensive guide for the user to set up their environment and run Python scripts to test the core assumptions of the project: whether perceptual hashing can survive social media compression and detect edits.
    -   **Changes**: Created by the AI to guide the user through the first week's technical validation tasks.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This document outlines the entire development plan from POC to a functional MVP over 13 weeks. It provides a clear, phased approach, breaking the large project into manageable milestones (POC -> Backend/Portal -> Mobile App -> Desktop Studio).
    -   **Changes**: Created by the AI to structure the project build.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: A simple, professional, mobile-friendly landing page for . It was created to give the user a tangible asset to share with potential partners while the main product is in development. It outlines the three main selling points of Rendr without revealing the secret technical methods.
    -   **Changes**: Created by the AI after an initial, poorly received version. This version is centered, uses sections, and is designed to be exciting.

-   **** and ****
    -   **Importance**: These guides provide instructions for the user to deploy the new  to their existing GitHub Pages site and clean up unnecessary files from previous experiments.
    -   **Changes**: Created by the AI in response to the user's request for help with their website.

-   **** and ****
    -   **Importance**: These are the entry points for the existing backend and frontend. They have not been modified yet, but they will be the foundation for building the verification API and the web portal/studio.
    -   **Changes**: None yet.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Complete Environment Setup**: The user still needs to install Git on their Windows machine.
- **Execute Week 1 POC**: The entire Proof-of-Concept plan is pending. This includes running Python scripts to test perceptual hashing against social media re-encoding and testing writes to the Polygon testnet.
- **Full 13-Week MVP Development**: The entire roadmap is pending, starting with backend API development in Week 2.

<current_work>
The current focus is on executing Day 1 of the Week 1 POC, which involves setting up the development environment on the user's Windows computer. This is a prerequisite for any coding or testing.

The user, who is not a developer, is being guided step-by-step through the installation process.

**Progress so far:**
1.  **Python Installation**: The user successfully installed Python 3.14.0. A small issue where

2.  **Node.js Installation**: The user successfully installed Node.js v24.11.1 (which includes npm v11.6.2). The AI explained that the lengthy installation process involving Chocolatey and Visual Studio Build Tools was normal and necessary for compiling native modules on Windows.

**The very last action** was the AI providing instructions for the final step of the environment setup: installing Git. The user has been instructed to download the Git for Windows installer and run it, keeping the default settings. The next step will be to verify that the Git installation was successful.
