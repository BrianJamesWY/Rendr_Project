<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants a massive UI overhaul for their creator platform, Rendr, based on several HTML files they provided. The key tasks are:
1.  **UI Overhaul:** Replace the existing Dashboard, Showcase, and Showcase Editor pages with new designs from the user's , , and  files.
2.  **Logo Integration:** Implement the user's official SVG logo from  and ensure it is large, clickable (links to the dashboard), and present on the top-left of every page, including pop-up modals.
3.  **Video Management System:** Create a comprehensive system for creators to manage their videos.
    *   A new My Videos page to view all uploaded videos and manage folders (create/rename).
    *   Clicking a video on the dashboard must open an Edit Video Details modal.
    *   The modal must allow editing the description, assigning to a folder, toggling visibility on the public showcase (), and adding links to where the video is posted on other social media sites.
4.  **Showcase Functionality:** The public showcase should only display videos marked . It should also support filtering by social media platform.
5.  **Visitor Experience:** When a visitor clicks a video on the showcase, a modal should appear showing video details and Take me There buttons for each social media link the creator provided.
6.  **New Features:** Build out the backend for the Community, Schedule, and Store tabs on the showcase.

The user is extremely frustrated with previous delays and having to repeat requests, emphasizing the need for the agent to be accurate and thorough.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The UI overhaul for the Dashboard, Showcase, and Showcase Editor pages is complete, using the user's provided HTML files. The new logo is integrated globally. A critical login bug caused by a token key mismatch and browser caching has been resolved. Placeholder backend APIs for , , and  have been created and registered. The backend video model and API () have been updated to support new fields like , , and . A new, but not fully functional,  page has been created. A suite of documentation files (, , ) was generated at the user's request.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was starting to implement the Edit Video Details modal. The user was frustrated because clicking a video on the dashboard incorrectly navigated to the verify page instead of opening this modal. The agent had just begun fixing this by modifying  to manage the modal's state.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: frontend testing agent. The agent should verify that clicking a video thumbnail on the dashboard opens the Edit Video Details modal. It must then test that submitting the form in the modal successfully updates the video details by checking the backend response and subsequently re-fetching the video list.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1**: Videos are not appearing on the  and  pages. (P0)
    -   **Description**: Despite the user uploading videos and the API confirming their existence, the frontend pages are not displaying them. The agent confirmed the backend API () is correctly returning video data, so the problem lies in the frontend.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent updated the showcase backend to filter by  and ran a script to set this flag on all existing videos. This did not resolve the frontend rendering issue.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        -   In  and , add  statements within the  hook to inspect the raw API response () and the state variable () after  is called.
        -   Verify the  function that renders the video list is correctly iterating over the  state array. Check for any conditional rendering logic that might be preventing the list from displaying.
        -   Suspect browser caching. Instruct the next agent to remind the user to perform a hard refresh ( or ) after changes are deployed.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is a critical bug blocking all video-related functionality. Fixing it will allow the user to see and manage their content.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: No.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1**: Implement the full video management and showcase feature set. (P0)
    -   **Where to resume**: The agent just started implementing the Edit Video Details modal in . The  page exists but needs its video display fixed.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: This will complete the core video management loop requested by the user, from editing details on the dashboard to controlling what visitors see on the showcase.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both
    -   **Blocked on something**: Issue 1 (Videos not displaying).

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **(P0) Complete the Edit Video Details Modal**: Finish the modal UI in , ensuring it has all the fields the user requested (description, folder selection,  checkbox, social media links) and correctly calls the  endpoint on save.
    -   **(P0) Implement Folder Management**: On the  page, add functionality for creators to create new folders and rename existing ones. This will require new backend API endpoints.

        -   **Should Test**: Frontend.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **JSX Parsing:** The agent had to convert large, complex HTML files with inline styles and scripts into valid React/JSX components, fixing numerous parsing errors.
-   **State Management for Modals:** The current task involves changing a page's behavior from navigation () to in-page state change () to display a modal.
-   **Frontend Debugging:** The session highlighted the importance of frontend-specific debugging, as multiple issues (login, video display) were caused by browser caching or frontend rendering logic, even when the backend API was working correctly.
-   **User-Centric Development:** The session underscores the critical need to follow user specifications exactly, as deviations (like navigating instead of opening a modal) led to significant user frustration.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The repeated, large-scale file replacements from raw HTML have likely introduced inconsistent styling and potential for non-reusable code. A pass to componentize elements within , , and  would be beneficial.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Now supports updating , , , and . This is the target for the Edit Video Details modal.
-   : Returns all videos for the logged-in user. Currently not rendering correctly on the frontend.
-   : Returns all public-facing videos for a user's showcase. Now correctly filters for .
-   : Now correctly initiates a Stripe Transfer.
-   , , : New placeholder endpoints that exist but do nothing.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **USER IS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED.** The user has repeatedly asked for the same features and feels their time and money have been wasted. You must read user requests with extreme care and precision. Do not make assumptions. Verify the current state of the application before planning new work. Prioritize the user's explicit instructions above all else.
-   **The user's last major request is in Chat Message 272.** This is your primary source of truth for the next set of tasks. The top priority is fixing the dashboard video click to open an Edit Video Details modal.
-   **The videos not displaying bug is critical.** Even though the API is working, the frontend isn't rendering the data. This is likely a frontend state or caching issue and must be solved before video management features can be tested.
-   **Acknowledge the user's frustration in your plan.** Explicitly state that you have read their feedback and will ensure their requests are implemented correctly this time.

**Last 5 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User (Test Feedback)**: Reported that uploaded videos appear in the dashboard stats but are not visible anywhere. (IN PROGRESS - Agent added a Recent Videos section to the dashboard, but it's not working).
2.  **User (Major Requirements)**: Provided a large, detailed list of features: My Videos page with folder management, an Edit Video Details modal triggered from the dashboard, social media folder logic, and a visitor-facing video modal. (IN PROGRESS - Agent started implementation but has not completed it).
3.  **User (Test Feedback)**: Reported that the agent's recent changes didn't work. Clicking a video still goes to the wrong page, and the  and  pages are still not showing any videos. (PENDING - This is the current state).
4.  **User (Frustrated Correction)**: Forcefully corrected the agent for not implementing the Edit Video Details modal as requested, and instead navigating to the My Videos page. The user repeated their exact instructions. (PENDING - Agent just started to fix this).
5.  **User (Frustrated Summary Note)**: Explicitly asked the agent to add a note to the summary stating their frustration about wasting time and money and having to repeat requests. (PENDING - This needs to be a key consideration for the next agent).

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**:
    -   Video display is broken across the application (, ). The API returns data, but the frontend doesn't render it.
    -   The primary user flow of clicking a video on the dashboard to edit it is broken and was the final point of user frustration.
-   **Mocked**: The Community, Schedule, and Store features are mocked with placeholder backend APIs and unconnected frontend tabs.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes**: YES (for login, but manual testing would have been faster).
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: YES (for the login issue).
-   **Test files created**: None.
-   **Known regressions**: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Creator Account**:
    -   Username: 
    -   Password: 

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent repeatedly failed to correctly implement the user's request from Chat Message 272 regarding the Edit Video Details modal. Despite multiple attempts and user corrections, the agent implemented a different navigation flow instead of the requested modal, which was the primary source of user frustration and the main task left unfinished. A majority of the other features requested in that same message (folder management, visitor modal, etc.) have not been started.</analysis>
