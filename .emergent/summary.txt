<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user, Brian, is building a video verification and content creator platform named Rendr Studio. The initial goal was a robust, multi-layered video verification system and role-based access. The user has now shifted focus to a large number of UI/UX enhancements and bug fixes across the platform, including the Dashboard, Showcase, Editor, and various modals. The user is highly concerned about regressions and has emphasized the need to follow existing standards and document all changes to prevent repeated work. Future goals include building out a RendrBodyCam feature and a Bounty.io integration.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Edit Video Modal Enhancements:**
    *   Add a button to delete the currently edited video.
    *   Implement functionality to *select* a new folder location for a video, not just display the current one.
2.  **Showcase Functionality:**
    *   Fix a bug where premium-tier videos incorrectly appear on the public/free Videos tab.
    *   On the Videos tab, clicking a video should open a new .
    *   The  must show a large thumbnail, description, a list of social media post locations, and a Play button.
    *   On the Premium Videos tab, remove the Enterprise label and the invalid date text.
    *   On the Premium Videos tab, add a Play button and a Video Details button (which opens the modal).
3.  **Dashboard & My Videos Page:**
    *   Fix the bug where video thumbnails are not appearing on the main Dashboard.
    *   Update the Bounties banner text on the Dashboard.
    *   On the  page, ensure it uses the latest version of the .
    *   Improve the overall organization and management features of the  page.
4.  **Bounties Page:**
    *   Update the title, descriptive text (to bullet points), and the main call-to-action button.
    *   The button should initially say Sign up for Bounties and lead to a new signup flow (to be built). After signup, it should revert to Post Bounty.
5.  **Documentation:** All changes must be documented in .

**what currently exists?**
The agent successfully fixed a critical and recurring frontend environment issue where an incorrect backend URL was being used, making the entire UI non-functional. This involved correcting hardcoded URLs, fixing the , and updating the  file. The agent also implemented and then debugged a delete functionality for videos and folders in the . Several other bugs and UI inconsistencies were fixed, including the video upload component (restoring a visible button, removing file restrictions, fixing duplicate detection), the dashboard (making uploaded videos appear), and the verification result page (fixing logo color/sizing and removing fake social media links). A Show on Showcase checkbox was added to the video editor modal.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **The user's last message contains a large, multi-part request.** You must break this down into a clear plan and get user confirmation before starting. Do not attempt to tackle it all at once.
-   **The user is extremely sensitive to regressions.** Double-check existing functionality before making changes. Refer to the provided documentation and the  file.
-   **The  file has been a recurring source of critical bugs.** If you encounter strange Network Error or CORS issues on the frontend, this file should be one of the first places you check, even though it's marked as read-only.
-   **The user has deferred several major features** (Blockchain, C2PA, AWS SES). Do not work on these until explicitly instructed.
-   **The application has multiple editor or management pages** (, ). Be sure you are applying changes to the correct page as specified by the user.
