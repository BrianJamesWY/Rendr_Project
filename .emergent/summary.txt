<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's primary goal is a massive UI and functionality overhaul for their creator platform, Rendr. The core features requested are:
1.  **Creator Monetization (Premium Folders):** Implement a system allowing creators to place videos in private, paid-access folders. This requires Stripe Connect integration for creator onboarding, subscription management, payment processing, and automated revenue sharing between the platform and creators.
2.  **Content Theft Bounty Hunter System:** A major new feature where creators can post bounties for users (hunters) to find stolen content across the web. This involves a marketplace for bounties, a verification workflow, and a payout system, also leveraging Stripe.
3.  **Complete UI Overhaul:** Convert a large number of user-provided HTML files into functional React components, redesigning the entire application from the landing page to the dashboard and settings.
4.  **Foundational Features & Fixes:** Create missing essential pages (e.g., Explore, Terms of Service), fix critical security vulnerabilities, and enhance existing admin panels with more detailed analytics.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB platform. In this session, the agent has made significant progress on multiple fronts:
-   **New Pages:** Created and integrated several new React pages from user-provided HTML, including , , and .
-   **Explore Feature:** A complete backend for the creator 'Explore' page was built (), featuring filtering, sorting, pagination, and endpoints for featured/trending creators. MongoDB indexes were created to support this.
-   **Monetization Backend Foundation:** The initial backend APIs and database models for  and  have been created. The  Python library has been installed, and service/API files (, ) have been created.
-   **Critical Security Fix:** A major security vulnerability in the CEO Admin page was identified and completely patched. The page was refactored to require a unique username/password, preventing an issue where a wrong password could grant access to a regular user's account.
-   **Stripe Integration:** The agent has guided the user through the initial Stripe account and Stripe Connect setup, and the user has provided the test API keys, which have been added to the environment.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: Guiding the user through the Stripe Connect setup process on the Stripe dashboard. The agent advised the user to select the **Accounts v2 API (Get started)** option, which is the correct choice to support the Platform model needed for both subscriptions and the future bounty system.
-   **Status**: BLOCKED
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Frontend testing agent. Once the Stripe setup is complete and the webhook secret is provided, the agent must test the full end-to-end user flow: creator onboarding via Stripe Connect, a user subscribing to a premium folder, and verifying the payment event is handled by the webhook.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   There are no active bugs. All pending work is related to new feature development.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1**: Complete Stripe Integration (P0)
    -   **Where to resume**: The agent is waiting for the user to complete the Stripe Connect setup wizard. The user needs to:
        1.  Click Get started (Accounts v2 API) on the Stripe dashboard.
        2.  Navigate to the **Developers → Webhooks** section.
        3.  Add a new endpoint with the URL: .
        4.  Select the required events: , , , .
        5.  Copy the generated **webhook signing secret** and provide it to the agent.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: A fully configured Stripe Connect integration, enabling the platform to process subscriptions, handle revenue splitting, and onboard creators.
    -   **Status**: BLOCKED (waiting on user action for webhook secret)
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both
    -   **Blocked on something**: User needs to provide the webhook signing secret.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks (P0):**
    -   **Test Premium Folders E2E:** Once Stripe is configured, perform a full end-to-end test of the premium folder subscription flow.
    -   **Connect Frontend to Monetization Backend:** Wire up the React components (, , ) to the live Stripe and premium folder APIs, replacing all mock data.
    -   **Implement Bounty Hunter System (Phase 1 - MVP):**
        -   Build the UI from user-provided HTML files (, , ).
        -   Develop the backend APIs for creating, browsing, and claiming bounties.
        -   Implement a manual admin workflow for verifying claims.
        -   Integrate Stripe Payouts to pay bounty hunters.

-   **Future Tasks (P1):**
    -   **Dashboard Redesign:** Implement the new dashboard design. The user has provided  as a placeholder but will provide a more polished version later.
    -   **Bounty System (Phase 2 & 3):** Implement semi-automated and then fully automated content theft verification using techniques like video fingerprinting and blockchain lookups.
    -   **Implement Follower System:** Add functionality for users to follow creators, a feature requested by the user.
    -   **Convert Remaining HTML to React:** Continue the UI overhaul by converting any remaining static HTML files.

    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Stripe Connect (Platform Model):** Chosen as the payment architecture to handle complex payment flows where the platform (Rendr) collects funds from users and automatically splits revenue with creators. This model will also support payouts for the future bounty system.
-   **Separated Admin Authentication:** The CEO Admin panel now uses a distinct authentication flow from regular users, relying on a username/password check against a hardcoded list of CEO user IDs in the backend.
-   **MongoDB Aggregation:** Used in the Explore page backend to efficiently query, join, and compute stats (video count, subscribers) for multiple creators in a single database call.

**key DB schema**
-   **users**: Existing schema. Key fields: , , .
-   **premium_folders** (New): 
-   **subscriptions** (New, To be built): 
-   **bounties** (Upcoming): 

**changes in tech stack**
-    Python SDK was installed and is now a core dependency for the backend.

**All files**
-   **/app/backend/api/explore.py**: New file containing all logic for the creator discovery feature.
-   **/app/backend/api/stripe_integration.py**: New file to handle all incoming Stripe webhooks and client-side requests for creating checkout/onboarding sessions.
-   **/app/backend/services/stripe_service.py**: New file to abstract all direct interactions with the Stripe API.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/Admin.js**: Heavily modified to fix a critical security vulnerability and implement a robust, separate login flow for the CEO.
-   **/app/backend/api/admin.py**: Modified to correctly check for the CEO's user ID after a database ID mismatch was discovered and resolved.
-   **/app/CEO_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS.md**: New file containing the updated, secure login credentials for the CEO panel.
-   **User-provided artifacts:** A large number of documents and HTML files related to the new Bounty Hunter System were provided and analyzed, forming the basis for the next major feature.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **Pre-existing Linting Errors:** A codebase-wide linting pass is needed to clean up numerous small errors and warnings in multiple frontend files.
-   **Dashboard.js:** This component remains a large monolith. The user has expressed a desire to replace it and has provided  as an initial concept.

**key api endpoints**
-   : New endpoint to fetch, filter, and sort creators for the public Explore page.
-   : New endpoint for creators to begin the Stripe Connect onboarding process.
-   : New endpoint for users to initiate a subscription to a premium folder.
-   : New endpoint to receive and process all events from Stripe (e.g., successful payments, subscription changes).
-   : Existing endpoint within the CEO panel, now secured and functional.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Stripe Webhook Secret is Required:** The immediate blocker is obtaining the webhook signing secret from the user. You cannot test or complete the payment integration without it. Guide the user to create the webhook endpoint and provide the secret.
-   **Database Name is :** A critical bug was caused by confusion between two databases,  and . The application exclusively uses ****. All direct database queries must target .
-   **Bounty System is Next:** After Premium Folders are live, the next major priority is the Bounty Hunter system. The user has provided extensive documentation. The agreed-upon strategy is a phased rollout, starting with an MVP that uses manual verification.
-   **CEO Admin Credentials:** The correct login credentials for the CEO panel are now stored in . The login process uses the  user account, and the backend verifies that this user's ID is on a list of authorized CEO IDs.
