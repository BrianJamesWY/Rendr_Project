**original_problem_statement:**
The user's primary goal has pivoted to a massive UI overhaul and the implementation of a creator monetization system. The core tasks are:
1.  **Creator Monetization (Premium Folders):** Implement a system allowing creators to place videos in private, paid-access folders. This involves:
    *   Integrating Stripe Connect for creator onboarding and payouts.
    *   Building backend infrastructure for subscriptions, payments, and revenue sharing.
    *   Creating frontend pages for creators to manage earnings and for users to subscribe to content.
2.  **Full UI Overhaul:** Convert a large number of user-provided HTML files into React components, effectively redesigning the entire application from the landing page to the settings pages.
3.  **Content Theft Detection System:** A future phase to build a system that allows creators to report stolen content, leveraging blockchain verification and an automated 3-strike/DMCA filing process.
4.  **Complete Foundational Pages:** Create several essential pages identified as missing, such as a 404 page, an Explore page for discovering creators, and Terms of Service.

The user has provided comprehensive documentation and HTML artifacts to guide this development, including  which serves as the master plan for the monetization feature.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack React/FastAPI platform. The previous session's agent resolved critical dashboard bugs and conducted a codebase-wide linting to improve quality.

The current session has been almost entirely focused on laying the groundwork for the user's new vision. The agent has successfully created two key documents to prevent context loss across forks:  and the critical .

A significant number of user-provided HTML files have already been converted into React pages and components (e.g., , , , , , , etc.), and their routes have been registered in . The agent was in the middle of creating another batch of requested pages when the session ended.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was fulfilling a user request to create 6 essential pages identified as missing. It successfully created  and  and was about to convert  into a React component.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Frontend testing agent. Once all 6 pages are created and routes are added, the agent should test that they all load correctly without errors.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   There are no active bugs. The entire focus is on new feature development and UI implementation.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1**: Complete New Page Creation (P0)
    -   **Where to resume**: The agent has created  and . It needs to create the following pages from user-provided HTML and instructions:
        1.   (from )
        2.   (from )
        3.   (from )
        4.  Update  to include the Transaction History section as requested by the user.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: This will complete the set of essential pages required for the initial launch of the monetization features.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something**: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks (P0):**
    -   **Implement Backend for Premium Folders & Subscriptions**: This is the highest priority task after the UI pages are created. The agent must follow  and  to build the entire backend, including Stripe Connect integration, new database models (subscriptions, transactions), and all necessary API endpoints for creating paid folders, processing payments, and handling creator payouts.
    -   **Convert Remaining HTML to React**: The user has provided more HTML files (, , , , etc.) that need to be converted to React components to complete the UI overhaul. The full list is documented in .

-   **Future Tasks (P1):**
    -   **Resume Real Event Tracking**: Continue the implementation of the analytics event tracking system. This involves connecting the frontend to the new  endpoint and updating the Investor Analytics dashboard to use real data.
    -   **Content Theft Detection System**: Begin work on the large-scale content protection system outlined in .
    -   **Dashboard Refactoring**: Refactor the monolithic  into smaller, manageable components.
    -   **Rewrite What is Rendr?**: The user requested a reminder to rewrite the content in .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None. The previous recurring issue (videos in folders on dashboard) was confirmed as resolved.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **UI Overhaul via HTML Conversion**: The primary activity is converting a full suite of static HTML design files into a functional React application, requiring componentization and route registration.
-   **Creator Monetization (SaaS)**: A major new feature direction to build a subscription platform on top of the existing application, using Stripe Connect to handle complex payment flows between users, creators, and the platform.

**key DB schema**
-   **analytics_events** (New, partially implemented): 
-   **Upcoming schemas required for monetization**: , , , .

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files**
-   **/app/MONETIZATION_HANDOFF_DOCUMENT.md**: Critical new document detailing the full plan for the monetization feature, including files to convert and backend requirements. Exists to prevent context loss.
-   **/app/RUNNING_TODO.md**: New document for tracking user requests and agent progress.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/**: Many new files created by converting user-provided HTML, forming the new UI.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Heavily modified to import and register routes for all the new pages.
-   **/app/backend/models/analytics_event.py & /app/backend/api/analytics_events.py**: New files creating the foundation for a real-time analytics system (currently paused).

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.js**: This large component still needs to be broken down into smaller, more maintainable pieces.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/Earnings.js**: Needs to be updated to incorporate the Transaction History feature as requested by the user.

**key api endpoints**
-   : New endpoint for analytics (implementation paused).
-   **Numerous endpoints are needed** for the monetization feature (e.g., , , , etc.). These are yet to be built.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Your Bible is **: The user and previous agent collaborated on this file to ensure you have all the context for the massive monetization feature. Refer to it for the list of UI pages to build and the backend integration plan.
-   **Monetization is Priority #1**: The user's entire focus has shifted to implementing Premium Folders and creator subscriptions. All other tasks are secondary.
-   **Continue the UI Overhaul**: The user is providing HTML files in batches. Your job is to continue converting them into React components. The handoff document lists which ones are still pending.
-   **Blockchain is on hold**: Do not work on any blockchain integration tasks. The user has explicitly stated they are not ready for this.

**documents created in this job**

**Last 5 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User**: States that the chat will end soon and requests a detailed artifact () to be created to preserve context for the next fork. Provides more HTML files. (COMPLETED - agent created the document).
2.  **User**: Provides another batch of HTML files, including the new landing page. (IN PROGRESS - agent created the landing page).
3.  **User**: Provides the final batch of HTML files for the UI overhaul. (PENDING - agent has logged these in the handoff document).
4.  **User**: Asks the agent to identify any missing pages needed for a complete platform. (COMPLETED - agent provided a comprehensive list).
5.  **User**: Requests the agent to immediately create 6 of the missing pages and provides clarifications on functionality (e.g., combine transaction history with earnings). (IN PROGRESS - agent started creating the pages).

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**: No part of the application is outright broken.
-   **Mocked**: The majority of the application's frontend is in a mocked state. Numerous new pages and components exist but are not yet connected to a functional backend. The monetization backend does not exist at all.
