<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to evolve the Rendr video verification platform into a comprehensive creator portfolio hub.

Initial requests included creator profiles, a dashboard, folder management, thumbnails, branding, and enhanced auth/admin features.

Throughout the session, the scope expanded significantly to include:
1.  **Advanced Showcase Page:** Go beyond simple video lists to include creator social media profile links, video descriptions, and links to original posts. The content should be organizable into Collections (formerly folders).
2.  **Creator Analytics:** A new section on the Creator Dashboard to track key metrics like total page views, individual video views, and clicks on social media links.
3.  **Powerhouse Showcase Editor:** A complete overhaul of the showcase editor, inspired by Linktree and Beacons.ai. It includes a multi-tabbed interface for managing themes, colors, layouts, typography, and effects, with features split between free and paid (Pro) tiers.
4.  **Enhanced Customization:** Ability for creators to upload a profile picture and a customizable header banner for their showcase page (Pro tier).
5.  **UX Improvements:** Make video thumbnails clickable to open an edit modal, removing the need for a separate Edit button.

The core goal is to provide creators with a feature-rich, customizable link-in-bio style landing page to consolidate their entire body of work.

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1**: Folder Management is broken across the Dashboard and Showcase Editor. (P0 - HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1**:
    -   **Description**: Despite multiple attempts and the creation of new APIs, the folder management functionality is not working as the user expects.
        1.  On the Creator Dashboard, clicking Save in the Create Folder modal does nothing; the folder is not created.
        2.  On the Showcase Editor, the UI for creating new folders and organizing videos into them is still missing or not functional.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent created a new  API to handle showcase-specific organization, added UI modals to , and added a Folders tab and rendering logic to . These fixes were unsuccessful.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  **Dashboard Fix:**
            -   Inspect . Check the  function. Is it correctly making a  request to ?
            -   Log the API response and any errors in the browser console.
            -   Verify the backend code in  correctly processes the request and saves the new folder to the database.
        2.  **Showcase Editor Fix:**
            -   Inspect . The user reports the UI is missing. Find out why the Folders tab and its  content are not being displayed correctly.
            -   Implement the UI for creating folders and a drag-and-drop interface (or simpler alternative) for assigning videos to these showcase folders, using the  endpoints.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- The core folder management functionality remains unresolved and is now the highest priority issue.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: The public showcase page () routing issue.
- **Recurrence count**: 1
- **Status**: RESOLVED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **Frontend:** React
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **File Storage:** Local file system for user-uploaded images ().

**key DB schema**
-   **users**: 
-   **videos**: 
-   **folders**:  (For internal dashboard organization)
-   **showcase_folders**:  (New, for public showcase organization)
-   **analytics_events**: 

**All files**
-   **New Files**:
    -   : Manages folder logic specifically for the public showcase page.
    -   : Defines the schema for analytics events.
    -   : A new page for users to manage profile picture, banner, and social media links.
-   **Heavily Modified Files**:
    -   : Completely rewritten to be a powerful, multi-tabbed page editor.
    -   : Updated with an analytics section, new modals, clickable thumbnails, and folder creation logic.
    -   : Reworked to display banners, social links, and organized video collections.
    -   : Added endpoints for profile picture and banner image uploads.
    -   : Expanded to include creator-facing analytics tracking.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-    is now extremely large and complex. It manages state for videos, folders, analytics, and multiple modals. It should be broken down into smaller components (e.g., , , , ).

**key api endpoints**
-   : Creates a new folder for the Creator Dashboard.
-   : Creates a new folder for the public Showcase page.
-   : Tracks a view of a creator's showcase page.
-   : Tracks a click on a social media link.
-   : Retrieves analytics data for the creator's dashboard.
-   : Handles profile picture uploads.
-   : Handles header banner uploads.
-   : Updates video details like description, tags, and platform.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Top Priority is User Trust:** The user is frustrated because the folder management feature has been requested multiple times and remains broken. Your immediate and primary goal is to fix this reliably. Do not move on to other tasks until the user confirms folder creation and organization works perfectly on both the Dashboard and the Showcase Editor.
-   **Manual Testing is Required:** Do not rely solely on the testing agent for the folder issue. Manually reproduce the user's steps: go to the dashboard, try to create a folder, and observe the failure. Check the browser console and network tab for errors.
-   **Two Folder Systems:** Be aware that there are now two distinct folder systems: one for internal organization on the dashboard () and one for public presentation on the showcase (). Ensure you are using the correct API for each context.

**Last 5 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User:** Provides detailed feedback on the new Showcase Editor, pointing out bugs (buttons, spacing) and requesting more features (multiple platforms per video, custom social buttons, folder links).
2.  **User:** Requests more major features: profile picture upload, clickable thumbnails instead of edit buttons, a customizable header banner, and fixing the Uncategorized folder logic.
3.  **User:** Submits a screenshot showing a syntax error that is breaking the Dashboard page.
4.  **User:** Reports that the Dashboard and Login pages are stuck on Loading... and asks for all pages and buttons to be made functional.
